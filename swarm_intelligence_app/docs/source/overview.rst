Overview
========

The aim of this project is to develop an open-source platform that fits well to the HolacracyÂ® constitution (http://www.holacracy.org/constitution).

The stack of choice is Flask, a flexible Python micro framework to develop robust web applications.  Different libraries, mentionable Flask-RESTful and Flask-SQLAlchemy, add further functionality to the stack. Data persistence is handled by a MySQL database.

To foster a fast, flexible and collaborative development process the project is hosted and maintained on GitHub (https://github.com/dcentralize/swarm-intelligence). Travis CI, a continuous integration service, makes it easy to test and to coordinate the commits and increases the quality of the product.
